    <h1>Kapil Dev</h1>
    <p>Kapil Dev Nikhanj born 6 January 1959 is an Indian former cricketer. He is regarded as one of the greatest
        all-rounders in the history of cricket, he was a fast-medium bowler and a hard-hitting middle-order batsman. Dev
        is the only player in the history of cricket to have taken more than 400 wickets (434 wickets) and scored more
        than 5,000 runs in Test.</p>

    <p>Dev captained the Indian cricket team that won the 1983 Cricket World Cup, becoming the first Indian captain
        to win the Cricket World Cup. He is still the youngest captain (at the age of 24) to win the World Cup for any
        team.[6] He retired in 1994, as the first player to take 200 ODI wickets, and holding the world record for
        the highest number of wickets taken in Test cricket, a record subsequently broken by Courtney Walsh in 2000.
        Kapil Dev held the record for the highest individual score (175*) scored by a batsman batting at number 5 or
        lower in ODIs until 2023, when it was superseded by Glenn Maxwell. He was also a part of the Indian squad
        which won the 1985 World Championship of Cricket. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kapil_Dev">wikipedia</a></p>
